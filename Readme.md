# Rock'n'Space

**Rock'n'Space** is a simple 2D arcade game which I made during the third semester of my Warsaw University of Technology course _Programming 3 - Advanced_. 

The main focus of this project was to acknowledge me with the basics of the real-time rendering technologies, collision detection algorithms and physical simulation.
